# Word analyzer
Simple makeshift tool to check how often a specific word occurs in an mp4/mp3 file.

## Usage
- Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Create a folder called 'input' in the same directory as the _main.py_
- Update the main function in _main.py_ to contain the correct parameters
- Execute script: `python main.py`

## Improvements
- Enter input file over command line
    - Check if already mp3 -> Don't have to convert
- Enter word to find over command line
- Improve audio chunk parameters for better transcript
